# Introduce:

This game genre is  shoot-em-ups, I prefer to let the game's action speak for itself. Generally, I made it referenced DoDonPachi(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoDonPachi) and Raiden(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiden_II), which are my childhood game memories.One thing I should speak is that player has two weapons, if tap button A, weapon 1, hold down button A, weapon 2.

# Requirement:

# Bugs:

Well,I have tried my best to fix all the bugs, but I still cannot guarantee it works correctly on your computer. If something does not work, you can record the error message, leave a message to me, I would be very happy if you do so :) 

# P.S:

Most keyboard (including mine) has rollover problems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)). So the default control may not work, say 2P control is not working correctly on my computer :) If you want to 2 player play , you can use two keyboards and set your own controls.

# Wing Craft(by xmzhang) 
==============
for pyweek 23

# Introduce:

This game genre is  shoot-em-ups, I prefer to let the game's action speak for itself. Generally, I made it referenced DoDonPachi(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoDonPachi) and Raiden(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiden_II), which are my childhood game memories.One thing I should speak is that player has two weapons, if tap button A, weapon 1, hold down button A, weapon 2. Sometimes, if weapon 2 failed, release button A, tap button A for sometime, then again hold down button A. The weapon 2 should be OK, I do not know the reason, if you know why, please tell me! :) 

# Requirement:

Python and Pygame is needed. 


# Play:

To run the game, simply run run_game.py



# Controls:

Use keyboard to control
{ 1P: 5 for coin, 1 for start, WSAD for directions, JK for button A B,
  2P: 6 for coin, 2 for start, arrow key for directions, num 1,2 for button A B}
In title page, press Tab key to set you own buttons

# Bugs:

Well,except the weapon 2 bug, I have tried my best to fix all the bugs, but I still cannot guarantee it works correctly on your computer. If something does not work, you can record the error message, leave a message to me, I would be very happy if you do so :) 

# P.S:

Most keyboard (including mine) has rollover problems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)). So the default control may not work, say 2P control is not working correctly on my computer :) If you want to 2 player play , you can use two keyboards and set your own controls. And also I have to say I use a lot of sprites this time, the background, the hud, even for common enemies, I use two sprites (one for mainpart, one for hitbox). and add the bullet sprites, there would be  more than one thousand sprites during the game. My computer is fine, but I am not sure it would be slow on other computer. So if that problem happens, have a newer computer to try it.
